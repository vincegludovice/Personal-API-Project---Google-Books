<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Personal API Project: Google Library
<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
**Google Library** is a web application that enables the user to search any books. 

## How It Works
- The user can type any keyword in the search bar and when the user press the Search/Enter Button, book results will be shown to the user. 
- The user then can see the Details of the book including the author, book image, published date and the publishing company who published it.
- The user can also view the Plot or the short description of the book. 
- The user can read a preview of the book. 
- If the user likes the preview, the user can add the book to his/her reading list. 
- When the user saves something to his/her reading list, the ISBN (book's unique key) is saved to the Local Storage so even when the user refreshes the page, the user can still see his/her list. 
- Lastly, the user can delete any book from his/her Reading List.
