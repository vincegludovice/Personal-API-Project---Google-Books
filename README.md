<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Personal API Project: Google Library
<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
**Google Library** is a web application that enables the user to search any books. The user can type any keyword in the search bar and when the user press the Search/Enter Button, results will be shown to the user. The user then can see the Details of the book including the author, book image, published date and who published it and the Plot or a short description. The user can also view the preview of the book. If the user likes the preview, the user can add the book to his/her reading list. When the user saves something to his/her reading list, it is saved to the localstorage so even when the user refreshes the page, the user can still see his/her list. Lastly, the user can delete any book from his/her Reading List.
